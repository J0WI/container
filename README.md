Container interface
==============

This repository holds all interfaces and utility code related to [PSR-11 (Container interface)][psr-link].

Note that this is not a Container implementation of its own. It is merely abstractions that describe the components of a Container.

You can see the [specification][psr-link] for more details and find implementations of the specification by looking for packages providing the [psr/container][implementation-link] virtual package.
